The essence of his new style lies in the fluid and unpredictable movements, as opposed to the traditional and rigid swordplay. Many pirates now aspire to learn from Zoro and adopt his new style, leading to its widespread popularity. Over the years, Zoro has honed and perfected his new style, sometimes through intense training, sometimes through battles at sea. Regardless, his new style remains unmatched.")

He was dubbed as such due to his exceptional sword skills and his relentless pursuit of strength. His reputation as a beast in battle precedes him, striking fear into the hearts of even the bravest of pirates.

It involves wielding three swords simultaneously, making him a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. The key to this style lies in its versatility, allowing Zoro to adapt to any situation and overcome any obstacle. Many pirates have attempted to mimic this style, but none have been able to truly master it. To this day, the Three Sword Style remains a closely guarded secret, known only to the greatest of swordsmen.')
